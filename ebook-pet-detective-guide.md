## Chapter 1: The First 30 Minutes

The moment you realize your pet is missing, your heart drops. Take a breath. The next 30 minutes are critical, but panic won't help.

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Search your home first** - Pets hide in strange places. Check:
   - Inside closets, under beds
   - Behind appliances (washer, dryer, fridge)
   - In boxes, bags, or containers
   - Garages and sheds
   - Under porches and decks

2. **Grab supplies:**
   - Their favorite treats (shake the bag!)
   - A squeaky toy or bell
   - A flashlight (even in daytime - eyes reflect)
   - Your phone (silent mode)
   - A leash or carrier

3. **Start local:**
   - Walk your immediate block calling their name
   - Use a calm, happy voice - not panicked
   - Shake the treat bag every 30 seconds
   - Check under every bush, car, and porch

## Chapter 2: Understanding Pet Psychology

### Dogs
Dogs are generally social and will approach people. However, a scared dog may:
- Run from anyone, including you
- Travel 5-10+ miles per day
- Follow roads, trails, or water
- Approach food sources (restaurants, dumpsters)

### Cats
Cats are territorial and typically stay close. A lost cat:
- Usually hides within 3-5 houses of home
- Won't come when called (even if they hear you)
- Comes out at night when it's quiet
- May be hiding in a neighbor's garage/shed

**The #1 mistake:** Chasing a scared pet. This pushes them further away.

## Chapter 3: Lost Dog vs Lost Cat

### Lost Dog Strategy
- **Expand search radius daily** - Dogs keep moving
- **Post in communities 30+ miles away**
- **Set up feeding stations** with trail cameras
- **Contact delivery drivers** - They cover lots of ground
- **Check with animal control daily**
- **Visit shelters in person** - Photos don't always match

### Lost Cat Strategy
- **Search at night** (10pm-2am) with a flashlight
- **Put their litter box outside** - They can smell it from far
- **Leave your worn clothing** outside
- **Set up a humane trap** near your home
- **Check neighbors' garages/sheds** - Ask them to look
- **Be patient** - Cats often return on their own after 3-7 days

---

## Chapter 4: The Art of the Search

### Timing Matters
- **Dawn (5-7am):** Quiet, pets may be moving
- **Dusk (6-8pm):** Pets come out to find food
- **Late night (10pm-2am):** Best for cats, very quiet

### Search Techniques
1. **Grid search:** Systematically cover every block
2. **Bait stations:** Leave food in multiple spots, check for activity
3. **Trail cameras:** Catch sightings while you sleep
4. **Ask everyone:** Mail carriers, joggers, dog walkers, kids

### What to Bring
- Flashlight (eyes reflect at night)
- Smelly food (tuna, hot dogs, rotisserie chicken)
- Treats in a noisy container
- Your worn clothing (your scent)
- Their favorite toy
- Phone on silent
- Leash/carrier
- Water for you

## Chapter 6: Working with Shelters

### The Reality
- Pets can be transported to shelters 60+ miles away
- Online databases aren't always current
- Staff changes - visit multiple times
- Microchip scanners can miss chips

### What to Do
1. **Call ALL shelters within 60 miles**
2. **Visit in person** at least twice per week
3. **File a lost pet report** at each one
4. **Bring a flyer** to leave with them
5. **Check the "found" section** of their website daily
6. **Ask about their hold policy** (how long before adoption)

### Don't Forget
- Animal control offices
- Police stations
- Vet offices (people bring found pets there)
- Pet stores
- Groomers

## Chapter 7: Night Search Techniques

Night searches are often the most effective, especially for cats.

### Your Night Kit
- Bright flashlight (sweep bushes slowly)
- Smelly food (tuna, hot dogs)
- Your worn clothing
- Their favorite squeaky toy
- Treats in a shaky container
- Phone on SILENT
- Comfortable shoes
- Patience

### The Technique
1. Go out between 10pm-2am
2. Walk slowly and quietly
3. Every 50 feet: stop, call softly, listen
4. Sweep flashlight under bushes, cars, porches
5. Look for eye reflection (they glow!)
6. **Sit quietly for 15-20 minutes** in one spot
7. Let them come to you

### Important
- Don't make sudden movements
- Keep your voice calm and soft
- If you spot them, DON'T CHASE
- Sit down, look away, offer food

## Chapter 8: When to Use a Trap

Humane traps work well for scared pets who won't approach humans.

### When to Consider
- Pet has been spotted but runs away
- Cat is hiding and won't come out
- Pet is injured or very scared
- It's been several days

### Trap Setup
1. Get a humane trap (borrow from shelter or buy)
2. Place near last sighting or your home
3. Bait with smelly food (tuna, sardines, rotisserie chicken)
4. Cover with a blanket (feels safer)
5. Check every few hours
6. Set up a trail camera to monitor

### Warning
- You may catch other animals (release them gently)
- Check frequently so your pet isn't stuck long
- Put a sign on the trap with your number

---

## Chapter 9: Long-Term Strategies

Don't give up. Pets have been reunited after weeks, months, even years.

### Keep the Search Alive
- Refresh social media posts weekly
- Replace weathered flyers
- Expand your search radius over time
- Keep checking shelters
- Leave food/clothing outside

### Stay Hopeful
- 93% of lost dogs are eventually found
- Many cats return on their own after weeks
- Microchipped pets have much higher return rates
- Someone may have taken them in temporarily

### Document Everything
- Keep a log of where you've searched
- Note any sightings (date, time, location, direction)
- Track which shelters you've called and when
- Save all social media posts

## Chapter 10: Prevention for Next Time

Once you're reunited, prevent it from happening again.

### Identification
- **Microchip** - The #1 way pets are returned. Keep info current!
- **Collar with ID tag** - Include phone number
- **GPS tracker** - Real-time location (AirTag, Fi, Whistle)
- **Pet ID card** - Keep in your wallet

### Home Security
- Check fence for gaps regularly
- Install a gate alarm
- Keep doors/windows secured
- Train "wait" at doorways
- Consider a GPS fence

### Behavior
- Train reliable recall (come when called)
- Spay/neuter reduces roaming
- Provide enrichment (bored pets escape)
- Address anxiety with a vet
